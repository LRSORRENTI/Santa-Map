# Santa Tracker

**Welcome to the Santa Tracker, a fun, interactive app that simulates Santa's deliveries in real-time. Using the power of Leaflet.js, this Next.js application visualizes Santa's journey across the globe, marking where he has delivered presents, where he is yet to deliver, and his current location.**

## Features

- **Real-Time Tracking**: Follow Santa's sleigh as it moves from one destination to another.
- **Interactive Map**: Click on any location to see details about Santa's arrival and departure times.
- **Custom Icons**: Visual cues including present icons for completed deliveries, tree icons for pending ones, and a special Santa icon for his current spot.
